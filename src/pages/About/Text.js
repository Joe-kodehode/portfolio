    Body: "I’ve always loved gaming, animals and I feel my most alive while being creative! In 2013 I moved from England to Norway and started working in a large toy store, a career I held up until the end of 2021. I was often praised for my communication skills as well as my will to improve the workplace and was duly appointed assistant-manager. The position was rewarding, however I’ve always had an aspiration for a career in programming. In my free time I developed skills in video (premier pro) and image editing (photoshop) in order to boost my store's social media presence, these new found skills in tech inspired me to take the leap and pursue that programming career path I always desired.",
